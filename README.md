![](https://github.com/Unexpecteddonuts/project_report/blob/main/cant%20save,%20cant%20simlate,%20errors%20very%20often.png?raw=true)
#### Discription
- The above error is shown as cant save if we try to save the circuit
- the internal error pop up is displayed in case of either saving or simulating.

### 2. QASM to Circuit 
#### Discription.
there is still no way a QASM circuit code can be concerted to a Circuit on the`Composer` and only after a successfull job do you get the QASM code foor your Circuit. but now there is a server error in all cases. ive trued this mornign afeternoon and eving at 2 hr intervals

### 3. Could not retest editing saved circuit as saving was not possible.

### 4. QASM code generator gives error if try to generate without measure statements. and once measure statement added #1 is the issue
