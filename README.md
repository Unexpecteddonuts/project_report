## 1. Editing saved circiut causes errors in output.
### Description:
When a particular circuit is saved and run the first time it produces the correct outcome. But once the circiut is saved and then edited after the first run, as in the measure statement is moved around to different order, whcih shouldnt change the output, the obtained output is incorrect and does not reflect all the possible qubit states.

## 2. Editing a proect requires you to renaming.
### Description:
After saving a project and running it, if i go back to editing the project and make a change it requires me to once again name it. 

## 3. Job name should be predefined:
### Description: 
Every run does not need oto be given a different job name, Job names be `<circuit_name>_<run_number>`

## 4. Cannot add gates beyond a certain pont:
### Description:
On a single lane you cannon add more than 7 to 8 entities, after which they all overlap and dont give you the desired circiut, which in turn makes extending the lanes using a scroll bar useless.
