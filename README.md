## 1. QASM to Circuit 
#### Discription.
there is still no way a QASM circuit code can be concerted to a Circuit on the`Composer` and only after a successfull job do you get the QASM code foor your Circuit. but now there is a server error in all cases. ive trued this mornign afeternoon and eving at 2 hr intervals

## 2. Editing saved circiut causes errors in output.
### Description:
When a particular circuit is saved and run the first time it produces the correct outcome. But once the circiut is saved and then edited after the first run, as in the measure statement is moved around to different order, whcih shouldnt change the output, the obtained output is incorrect and does not reflect all the possible qubit states.

## 3. Editing a proect requires you to renaming.
### Description:
After saving a project and running it, if i go back to editing the project and make a change it requires me to once again name it. 
Job name also muct be `<circuit_name>_<run_number>`
