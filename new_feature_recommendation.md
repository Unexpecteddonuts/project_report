### Discription
Addition of basic classical gates such as the NOT gate, without these gates simple algorithms such as grovers algorithm too aren't possible.

Adition of Phase Change Operators such as the PhaseGate, RZ(Z-axis Rotation) Gate, Tdg gate.

The addition of Quantum operators such as RCCX, RCCCX, SX(squareroot of X) Gate, U, etc gates as more complex Algorithms would require these, and since the algorithms will mainly be submitted in Qiskit(which will be converted to QASM(OpenQasm 2.0)) and these gates are available in qiskit and without them those tasks would not be able to eb executed.

Adding of the basic Reset operator.
